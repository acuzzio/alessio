  ## My tools

  I leveraged many programming languages and techniques to deliver prime chemistry software. My workhorses are Python and Bash, 
  but I also employed pure functional programming, like Haskell, or extremely optimized routines in CUDA, cython, fortran and C++. 
  I have a passion for data analysis and video effects.
